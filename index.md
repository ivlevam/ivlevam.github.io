# Hello!
I am an **English teacher**

As a BA in Linguistics with a degree in English Teaching, I am very interested in continuing to teach in your country. With experience at both the elementary and high school levels, as well as in classroom settings outside of the traditional classroom, I have a variety of experiences to offer.

My first classroom teaching experience was in a public school, when I worked as a teacher in primary and secondary schools for five years. In addition, I worked for several years as a class teacher, coordinating students in their studies and extracurricular activities.

I have teaching experience from second to ninth grade. During this work experience, I enjoyed working with children. My careful preparation of the lessons allowed me to break down complex concepts into simple examples that my young students could understand, which was helpful to both my students and myself. Managing the difference in ability among my students proved to be a difficult but rewarding task
